# Weather-App
This is my weather app. I've used a public api to give the weather in any province in Canada at any time. On default it will show the average temperature in Ontario, the humidity, the wind speed, and an icon indicating whether it's sunny, coudy, windy, night time, etc. The user can type their province into the input to view what the weather is like! 

This project utlizes an asynchronous function that fetches data from a public API. When the user searches for a province, the asynchronous function will run and look for the specific data in this province. Based off of the data, other functions are tasked with sorting, and displaying said data to the webpage.
